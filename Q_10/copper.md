# ATT copper network retirement 

## What to know

We sent you a notice to let you know about changes to our network. Today, you receive internet or phone services to your home over our legacy copper-wire network. We're replacing it with a new fiber-optic network.

This change to the fiber optic network means we'll need to update your internet equipment. We'll get in touch with you to set up an installation time. We'll also discuss any impacts to your current internet speed tier and to other AT&T services you may have, if any. Here's the best part: We'll make this upgrade to the fiber-optic network at no extra cost to you.

If you have:

Internet service: You may have options for lower cost plans with the same or better features, such as faster internet speeds.

Traditional or digital home-phone service: Your prices and plans will stay the same for now with all the same features-unless you request other changes.

U-verse TV service: You can keep your current plan at the same price for now. You can also use your existing equipment unless you choose to upgrade.
Important: Make sure you check the notice we sent you. It includes the date by which you must transfer your service.
Installation details

The installation usually takes between two and four hours. You (or an authorized adult) must be home for the entire time. That way, we'll have access to install new equipment and update your service. Plus, your input will help our technician choose the right options to fit your needs.

## Will the change affect devices that use my current phone service?
Devices will work the same after the fiber optic upgrade. This includes alarms, medical monitors, and faxes. However, these won't work during a power outage without a backup battery

## How will my traditional AT&T home-phone service change?

After the update, your home phone service will have the same functions and features. You can use your current phones just as you do now. Your rate plan will also remain the same unless you request changes. The biggest difference is that fiber optic cables can't carry electrical currents, so the new equipment will need to use your home's electrical power to work. If you want power during an outage, you'll have to buy a backup battery.

## How will my AT&T Phone digital voice plan change?

Your digital voice plan and rate will stay the same for now unless you make changes. However, the new equipment will need your home's electrical power to work, so you'll need backup batteries to use digital phone service during a power outage.

## Can I get other AT&T services with the fiber optic network?

Yes, you can get:

Digital voice

High-speed internet
