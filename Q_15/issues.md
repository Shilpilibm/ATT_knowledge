## What Is Throughput in Networking?

So, how do we define throughput? Again, network throughput refers to how much data can be transferred from source to destination within a given timeframe. Throughput measures how many packets arrive at their destinations successfully. For the most part, throughput capacity is measured in bits per second, but it can also be measured in data per second. Packet arrival is key to high-performance service within a network. When people use programs or software, they want their requests to be heard and responded to in a timely fashion. Packets lost in transit lead to poor or slow network performance, and low throughput indicates problems like packet loss.

Using throughput to measure network speed is good for troubleshooting because it can root out the exact cause of a slow network and alert administrators to problems, specifically in regard to packet loss. Packet loss, latency, and jitter are all related to slow throughput speed. Latency is the amount of time it takes for a packet to make it from source to destination, and jitter refers to the difference in packet delay. Minimizing all these factors is critical to increasing throughput speed and data performance.

## What is network latency?

Network latency is the delay in network communication. It shows the time that data takes to transfer across the network. Networks with a longer delay or lag have high latency, while those with fast response times have low latency. Businesses prefer low latency and faster network communication for greater productivity and more efficient business operations. Some types of applications, such as fluid dynamics and other high performance computing use cases, require low network latency to keep up with their computation demands. High network latencies cause the application performance to degrade, and at high enough levels to fail.

Network latency (sometimes referred to as lag) is best described as the delay in the time that data takes to transfer across a network. A long delay indicates high latency, while faster response times have low latency.

How to Fix Latency
Latency can fluctuate in small amounts from one minute to the next, but the additional lag from small increases can be noticeable. The following are common reasons for internet lag, some of which are out of your control:

Replace or add a router. Any router eventually bogs down if too many clients use it at the same time. Network contention among multiple clients means that those clients sometimes wait for each other's requests to be processed, causing lag. To fix this, replace the router with a more powerful model, or add another router to the network to alleviate this problem.

Similarly, network contention occurs on a residence's connection to the internet provider if saturated with traffic.
Avoid simultaneous downloads. Depending on the speed of your connection, avoid too many simultaneous downloads and online sessions to minimize lag.

Don't use too many applications at once. PCs and other client devices become a source of network lag if unable to process network data quickly. While modern computers are sufficiently powerful in most situations, devices can slow down if too many applications run simultaneously. If you think you have too many programs open, close a few.

Running applications that don't generate network traffic can introduce lag. For example, a misbehaving program can consume all the available CPU, which delays the computer from processing network traffic for other applications. If a program doesn't respond, force it to close.

Scan and remove malware. A network worm hijacks a computer and its network interface, which can cause it to perform sluggishly, similar to being overloaded. Running antivirus software on devices connected to the network detects and removes these worms.

Use a wired connection instead of wireless. Online gamers, as an example, often prefer to run their devices over wired Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi because Ethernet supports lower latencies. While the savings is typically only a few milliseconds in practice, wired connections also avoid the risk of interference that can result in significant lag.

Utilize local cache. One way to reduce latency is to utilize caching in your browser, which is a way for the program to store recently used files so that you can access those files locally the next time you request files from that site (no download is necessary).

Most browsers cache files by default, but if you delete the browser cache too often, it takes longer to load the same pages you recently visited.
Other Causes of Latency Issues
Some latency issues can be fixed, but the following are latency issues that aren't usually in your control.

Traffic Load
Spikes in internet use during peak usage times of day often cause lag. The nature of this lag varies by the service provider and the geographic location. Other than moving locations or changing internet service, an individual user can't avoid this kind of lag.

Online Application Load
Online multiplayer games, websites, and other client-server network applications use shared internet servers. If these servers become overloaded with activity, the clients experience lag.

Wireless Interference
Satellite, fixed wireless broadband, and other wireless internet connections are susceptible to signal interference from the rain. Wireless interference causes network data to be corrupted in transit, causing lag from re-transmission delays.

Lag Switches
Some people who play online games install a device called a lag switch on their local network. A lag switch intercepts network signals and introduces delays in the flow of data back to other gamers connected to a live session. You can do little to solve this kind of lag problem other than avoiding playing with those who use lag switches

## What causes a ‘dead zone?’
Cellular signals come from towers that transmit a signal. While there’s no shortage of cell towers in all but the most remote locations, many other factors can prevent these radio frequency (RF) cellular signals from reaching your mobile device. Areas where something is standing between the nearest cell tower and your mobile device are known as dead zones. In these spots, devices cannot access a strong enough signal to function properly on a cellular network.

Causes for dead zones:

Distance from cell towers – If you’re in one of the few remaining remote areas that lack sufficient cell tower coverage, connections will obviously be tricky. Even if you do get a signal in these areas, it is often spotty, resulting in dropped calls, lost connections, and a drained battery as your phone or device searches endlessly for signal.
Terrain/Environment – There are several types of terrain that can obstruct signals from cell towers. Mountains, hills, and bluffs can all render an area a dead zone by absorbing cell signals before they reach a mobile device. Tall trees, dense forests, and other vegetation can also act as barriers to cell signal waves.
Metal and glass in vehicles – The materials that are used to keep us safe inside of our cars, or on trains and subways, can also keep cellular signals out. Most of us willingly accept this tradeoff, but those materials are often the reasons we experience dropped calls while in transit. That’s why you’ll often find that rolling down a car window can quickly boost the quality of a call.
Building construction materials – Brick, concrete, and the steel materials used in the construction of commercial buildings, bridges, tunnels and parking garages are notorious cell signal obstructors. Green building materials, including LEED-certified windows, can also hamper cell service. All of these materials can be difficult for cellular signals to penetrate, and can render an already weak signal useless.
Atmospheric/weather conditions – Turbulent storms, thick fog, and other weather conditions can easily disrupt cell signals.

Network Problem #1. Intermittent Network Problems 
 
Intermittent network problems are a frustrating and common network issue characterized by sporadic disruptions in network connectivity and performance. Unlike consistent or continuous problems, intermittent issues occur irregularly, making them challenging to diagnose and troubleshoot.

These problems can manifest in various ways, including intermittent connection drops, slow data transfer, or periods of complete network unavailability.

I. The Consequences of Intermittent Network Problems: 
 
Unpredictable Performance: Intermittent issues make network performance unpredictable, leading to inconsistent user experiences.
Unreliable Connectivity: Users may experience unreliable connectivity, with connections dropping unexpectedly or becoming temporarily unresponsive.
Productivity Loss: Intermittent network problems can disrupt workflow and lead to productivity losses.
Difficult Troubleshooting: Diagnosing intermittent issues can be challenging and time-consuming, delaying the resolution process.

Network Problem #2. High Bandwidth Usage 
 
Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data transmitted over an Internet connection in a given amount of time.

It refers to a network’s capacity to transfer data between devices or the Internet within a given span of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for Internet speed when it's actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).

Higher bandwidth allows data to be transferred across your network at a faster rate and can sustain a larger number of connected devices all at once - but it can significantly impact network performance and user experience.

It occurs when a considerable amount of data is being transmitted over the network, leading to increased congestion and potential bottlenecks. When someone or something, like a large application, on your network is monopolizing your bandwidth by downloading gigabytes worth of data, it creates a congestion in your network.

This excessive data transfer can result from various factors, both legitimate and non-legitimate, and it's essential to identify and address the root cause to maintain a smoothly functioning network.

high bandwidth usage - Common Network Problems

I. The Consequences of High Bandwidth Usage: 
 
Network Congestion: Network congestion caused by high bandwidth usage, also runs the risk of leaving insufficient amounts of bandwidth for other parts of your network that need it. When this happens, you may start experiencing problems like slow download speed over the Internet.
Slow Network Performance: High bandwidth consumption can lead to slower network speeds, causing delays in accessing resources and data.
Latency and Packet Loss: As network resources become saturated, latency (delay) and packet loss may increase, affecting real-time applications like VoIP or video conferencing.
Reduced Productivity: Sluggish network performance can hamper productivity, as users may experience delays in performing critical tasks.
Increased Costs: Excessive bandwidth usage can lead to overage charges from internet service providers (ISPs) if they exceed the Internet SLA, or the need to upgrade to higher-tier plans, resulting in higher operational costs. Network Downtime: In extreme cases, high bandwidth usage can lead to network outages if the infrastructure is not equipped to handle the traffic load.

Network Problem #3. High CPU Usage 
 
CPU, or “ Central Processing Unit”, is the primary component of a computer that receives and processes instructions for operating systems and applications.

High CPU usage is another common network problem that can significantly impact the performance and stability of a network. It occurs when the central processing unit (CPU) of a network device, such as a router, switch, firewall, or server, is operating at or near its maximum capacity. This can lead to various issues that affect the overall network functionality and user experience.

With such a big job on its shoulders, the signs of high CPU usage on a network device are a very troubling sign for many of us. As your network devices continue to work harder to perform an increasing amount of tasks, it increases the chance that things can go wrong.

Network Downtime: In extreme cases, when the CPU is overwhelmed, the device may become unresponsive, leading to network outages and disruptions.
Security Vulnerabilities: High CPU usage can leave network devices more vulnerable to security threats as their ability to handle security tasks is compromised.

Network Problem #4. Physical Connectivity Issues 
 
It may seem obvious, but some network issues may occur with the hardware outside of the network.

When the time comes to troubleshoot network issues, our instinct is often to think about the most complex situations, when sometimes the problem is actually very simple and right in front of us.

Hardware problems like defective cables or connectors can generate network errors on the network equipment to which it is connected. You may think that this problem is due to a network outage or network failure, or Internet connection problem, but it’s actually because you have a broken or malfunctioning cable.

This can also occur outside of the LAN network. If a copper cable, or fiber-optic cable is damaged, it will likely reduce the amount of data that can go through it without any packet loss.

I. The Consequences of Physical Connectivity Issues 
 
Physical connectivity problems can manifest in various ways, leading to network outages, slow data transfer, or intermittent connectivity.

Network Outages: A complete loss of physical connectivity can lead to network outages, preventing users from accessing network resources.
Intermittent Connectivity: Loose or damaged cables may cause intermittent connectivity issues, resulting in unreliable network access.
Slow Data Transfer: Poor physical connections can lead to data transmission errors and retransmissions, slowing down data transfer rates.
Increased Downtime*: The time spent identifying and resolving physical connectivity issues can lead to increased network downtime and reduced productivity.


Network Problem #5. Malfunctioning Devices or Equipment 
 
Sometimes, network issues occur within network equipment or devices like Firewalls, Routers, Switches, Wifi APs.

Malfunctioning devices or equipment are a common network problem that can disrupt network operations and lead to various connectivity issues. This category encompasses hardware failures or malfunctions within network devices, such as routers, switches, firewalls, servers, or network interface cards (NICs). When devices malfunction, they may experience performance degradation or cease to function altogether, impacting the overall network performance and user experience.

You need to ensure that all the devices on your network are configured correctly in order for your network to work properly. Whenever you install or reconfigure a device, or upgrade equipment firmware on your network, you need to test that device to ensure that it’s been configured correctly.

Many network performance issues are caused by device misconfigurations that can affect different parts of your network and turn into major problems down the line. That’s why you need to pay attention to all the switches and devices on your network to ensure that they’re always working as they should be, and react quickly if they aren’t.

I. The Consequences of Malfunctioning Devices or Equipment 
 
Network Downtime: When crucial network devices fail, it can result in network outages and disrupt communication and data transfer.
Slow Performance: Malfunctioning devices may struggle to process network traffic efficiently, leading to slow data transfer and increased latency.

Reduced Reliability: Frequent device malfunctions erode the network's reliability, causing frustration for users and hindering business operations.

Network Problem #6. DNS Issues 
 
DNS or Domain Name System, controls how visitors find your website over the Internet.

It is essentially a directory for the Internet (and every Internet-connected device) that matches domain names with IP addresses. Every single website has its own IP address on the web, and computers can connect to other computers via the Internet and look up websites using their IP address. When you type in a domain name in your Internet browser, DNS works to find the information connected to that domain.

DNS issues are very common network problems that many people tend to overlook. DNS issues occur when you are unable to connect to an IP address, signalling that you may have lost network or Internet access. For example, your site can simultaneously appear online for you, but looks to be offline to your visitors.

When DNS issues arise, users may experience difficulties accessing websites, sending emails, or connecting to network resources.

I. The Consequences of DNS Issues 
 
The inability to access the Internet or particular sites can have a very immediate and negative impact on your business - especially if it means that users cannot access your site. Just a few hours offline can cost your company in more ways than one, which is why it’s important to find and fix DNS problems as soon as possible.

Website Inaccessibility: Users may be unable to access websites or services due to failed DNS resolutions.
Email Delivery Issues: DNS problems can affect email delivery, causing delays or preventing emails from being sent or received.
Slow Internet Browsing: DNS lookup delays can result in sluggish website loading times and overall slow internet browsing experiences.
Security Risks: DNS hijacking or cache poisoning can lead to security vulnerabilities, exposing users to phishing attacks or other malicious activities
