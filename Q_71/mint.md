## What is Mint Mobile?
Mint Mobile, LLC is a mobile virtual network operator owned by T-Mobile US that offers prepaid mobile phone plans with physical SIM cards or eSIMs.

Mint's unique offering is that users don't pay a monthly rate to the carrier; instead, they pay in advance for anywhere from three to 12 months of service, with bigger discounts for longer commitments. Pay in advance for a year of service, and you'll get Mint's best rate.

Like many prepaid carriers, Mint is what's considered an MVNO, or mobile virtual network operator. MVNOs operate on the infrastructure of existing networks: in Mint's case, that network is T-Mobile. 

T-Mobile offers nationwide 5G service, with 5G coverage reaching 330 million people in the U.S. And as noted above, 5G service is extended to MVNOs like Mint. If you've got a 5G phone for your Mint service, you can take advantage of T-Mobile 5G infrastructure as part of your plan.
