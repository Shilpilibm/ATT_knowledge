## What is a network outage?

A mobile network outage is an unexpected disruption that impacts many cell sites at the same time. This can result in the loss of services such as voice calling, data transmission like email or internet access, and text messaging for mobile device users within the affected area. It's important to understand that a mobile network outage isn't the same as having no coverage or a weak signal—which are different issues that can affect the quality of your service but aren't classified as outages. 

## Why do network outages occur?

Mobile network outages could be due to a variety of factors, including technical glitches, server failures, infrastructure damage, or even cyber attacks.
Network outages can be local to one neighborhood, a small region, or even a small subset of users. This is called a partial outage, where only certain parts of the mobile network are impacted.
In rare events, network outages can be widespread across the United States. This is called a global network outage. During a global cellular network outage, cell phones and other devices that connect to the wireless network may have trouble connecting to their cellular provider's network. 

## Is it a network outage or an issue with my specific device?

Network outages do happen. But most of the time there's an issue with a specific device that you can resolve with a few troubleshooting steps.  
If you can't make or receive calls on your AT&T mobile phone, first try the following: 
Restart your device  
Make sure Airplane Mode is off 
Confirm the cell phone number you're having issues with is active on your account by signing into your AT&T account 
Check the AT&T network coverage map to make sure you're trying to use your device from within an area covered by AT&T  

## How can I stay connected during a cellular network outage?
Cellular network outages don't occur frequently, but like with any service provider, things do happen, and it's always best to have a backup. So, what can you do if there's a network outage and you don't have service? During a network outage we recommend you connect to Wi-Fi® for a data connection, and activate Wi-Fi Calling on your device for voice calls.
It's always important to be prepared ahead of emergencies. Make sure you set up Wi-Fi Calling on your device before you actually need to use it and before any network outages occur. Turn on Wi-Fi Calling now to reduce losing network access in the event of a future network outage. Keep reading to learn more about Wi-Fi Calling. 

## What is Wi-Fi Calling from AT&T?
AT&T Wi-Fi Calling lets you make calls and send text messages over Wi-Fi when a cellular signal is limited or unavailable. It's easy to use, doesn't cost extra, and you can set it up right from your smartphone settings.  
There are very interesting use cases where Wi-Fi Calling comes in handy. If you live or are traveling through rural areas, Wi-Fi Calling allows you to connect to Wi-Fi internet to send texts, emails, and make phone calls from your cell phone or tablet device. If you're inside a hospital where mobile signals are often weak or unavailable, Wi-Fi Calling may save the day. Another interesting benefit of Wi-Fi Calling is that it may save your cell phone battery life because your cell phone won't constantly search for a signal if you know that a cellular tower isn't within reach. 

## Are there disadvantages to Wi-Fi Calling?
Wi-Fi Calling can be a fantastic option in case of a network outage, and even in many other situations where your wireless signal is limited or unavailable. But there are a few points to consider: 
Stable Wi-Fi connection required: If you switch to Wi-Fi Calling and don't have a stable Wi-Fi connection, you may experience poor-quality or dropped calls. It's also important to consider bandwidth capacity—or in other words, how many devices are currently using your Wi-Fi when you're calling through Wi-Fi Calling. The more devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network, the more bandwidth they'll take up. This, in turn, may reduce your call quality.  
 
Dead zones inside your home: If you have weak spots in your home where coverage is especially poor—like in a basement—consider investing in a Wi-Fi extender to boost the Wi-Fi signal inside your home. Learn more about Wi-Fi extenders and how they work 
 
Internet data caps: If your internet plan that powers your Wi-Fi has a data cap on it, frequent Wi-Fi Calling will eat into that data which might make you reach your data limit faster. If you're looking for unlimited internet plans, explore AT&T's fiber internet fiber plans.
